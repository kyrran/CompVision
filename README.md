# Computer Vision

This repository is only for storing assignments of CS4186 Computer Vision and Image Processing.

First coursework is to implement two methods for instance search. Specifically, given a query instance with the instance bounding box location in the query instance image (stored in the query_txt directory with the same name of query instance image), a method needs to find the images that contain the same query instance from the image collection （5000 images） and then ranks them according to similarity or confidence. The 20 testing query images are used for evaluating the performance of your implementation.

The second coursework is about stero matching.
